- 👋 Hi, I’m @jglaspey
- 👀 I’m interested in the web and people being nice to each other.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write better, to work with people better, and to build more interesting things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something, but I don't know what.
- 📫 How to reach me @jasonglaspey on twitter is a good start.
